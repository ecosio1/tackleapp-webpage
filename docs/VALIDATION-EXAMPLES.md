## Overview

These examples show exactly what is allowed and what is forbidden in blog posts. Use these as templates when creating content.

## Example 1: Regulations Section

### ❌ BAD - Includes Specific Regulations (WILL BE REJECTED)

```markdown
## Regulations

Florida snook regulations:
- Slot limit: 28-32 inches
- Bag limit: 1 fish per angler per day
- Closed seasons: December 1 - January 31 and June 1 - August 31

- ❌ Includes specific bag limits (1 fish per day)
- ❌ Includes specific closed seasons (December-January, June-August)
- ❌ Makes legal claims about licenses

### ✅ GOOD - Specific and Actionable

```markdown
### 1. Soft Plastic Jerkbaits

Florida snook. Their realistic swimming action and versatility make
them a must-have.

**Best Conditions:** Dawn, dusk, moving water
**Technique:** Twitch-pause-twitch retrieve near structure
**Color Selection:**
- Clear water: White, clear, silver

**Where to Fish:** Cast along mangrove shorelines, dock pilings,
and bridge structures during incoming tides.
