What you need: Medium-action rod, 10-15 lb test line, spinnerbaits, soft plastics. **DO THIS FIRST**: Start with a spinnerbait for immediate results in most conditions.\n\n## 2. Quick Answer\n\n- **Lure Choice**: Spinnerbait, soft plastic worm, and jerkbait.\n- **Where to Fish**: Near weed lines, submerged logs, and drop-offs.\n- **Retrieve Pattern**: Steady with occasional pauses for spinnerbaits; slow and subtle for soft plastics.\n- **Best Conditions**: Overcast skies or early morning, with a light breeze.\n- **Tide/Time/Wind**: Fish during low light conditions with a light wind for the best results.\n\n## 3. Tackle Box Snapshot\n\n- **Lures**: Strike King Spinnerbait, Zoom Trick Worm, Rapala X-Rap Jerkbait.\n- **Hooks/Jig Weights**: 1/4 oz jig heads for soft plastics, size 3/0 hooks.\n- **Line/Leader Setup**: 10-15 lb monofilament or fluorocarbon line, 12-18 inch leader.\n- **Retrieve Patterns**: Spinnerbait: steady retrieve with periodic pauses. Soft plastics: lift and drop slowly. Jerkbait: twitch-twitch-pause.\n- **Target Depth/Structure**: Fish at 3-10 feet around structure like weed beds and submerged logs.\n\n![Fishing tackle and lures laid out](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1515023115689-589c33041d3c?w=800&h=600&fit=crop)\n*Caption describing the complete setup and scenarios it covers*\n\n## 4. Step-by-Step\n\n1. **Where to Start**: Seek out structures like weed lines and submerged logs in 3-10 feet of water.\n2. **First Casts**: Cast at a 45-degree angle to the structure, aiming for a distance of 30-40 feet.\n3. **Retrieve Cadence**: Use a steady retrieve for spinnerbaits, feeling for vibration. For plastics, feel for subtle taps.\n4. **Hookset and Landing Tips**: Set the hook with a swift upward motion when you feel resistance. Keep tension on the line to avoid losing the fish.\n5. **What to Change**: If no bites in 10-15 minutes, switch lure colors or move to a new location with deeper water.\n\n![Angler casting or fishing technique demonstration](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1544552866-d3ed42536cfd?w=800&h=600&fit=crop)\n*Caption explaining the technique and why it matters*\n\n## 5. Decision Tree\n\n- **If water is clear**: Use natural-colored lures like green pumpkin or watermelon.\n- **If water is stained**: Opt for brighter colors like chartreuse or white.\n- **If windy**: Use heavier lures to maintain control, and fish closer to cover.\n- **If cold front/pressure drop**: Slow down your retrieve and use smaller baits.\n- **If bait is present**: Match the hatch with similar size and color lures.\n- **If no bait visible**: Use search baits like spinnerbaits to locate fish.\n\n## 6. Spot Playbook\n\nBass often stage on edges of weed beds, around submerged logs, and along drop-offs in 5-12 feet of water. Approach these areas quietly, casting from a distance to avoid spooking fish. The strike zone is typically within 3-5 feet of the structure. Look for shadows and current seams where bass might ambush prey.\n\n![Fishing structure or habitat photo](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559827260-dc66d52bef19?w=800&h=600&fit=crop)\n*Caption with depth, conditions, and when to target this spot*\n\n## 7. Mistakes That Kill the Bite\n\n- **Too fast retrieve**: Misses fish that are not actively chasing.\n- **Wrong depth**: Lures not in the strike zone go unnoticed.\n- **Noisy approach**: Scares fish away from the area.\n- **Working lure too much**: Unnatural movement can deter fish.\n- **Wrong angle to current**: Makes lures appear unnatural.\n- **Not pausing long enough**: Fish might strike during pauses.\n- **Changing spots too quickly**: Misses fish that require more coaxing.\n- **Setting hook on topwater explosion**: Often results in missed strikes.\n- **Fishing wrong tide stage**: Fish are less active during slack tides.\n- **Using dull hooks**: Reduces hooking efficiency.\n- **Leader too short**: Increases visibility to fish.\n- **Ignoring shadow lines**: Misses ambush points for bass.\n\n![Fish or detail closeup](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1592329347327-27c7e288b5f6?w=800&h=600&fit=crop)\n*Caption highlighting successful technique or important detail*\n\n## 8.
